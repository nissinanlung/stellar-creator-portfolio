/**

 *
 * SEP-24 interactive deposit/withdraw client (Issue #1393).
 *
 * Both SEP-24 components were TODO stubs: `components/features/sep24-flow.tsx`
 * only tracked UI state, and `components/sep24-flow.tsx` logged the form
 * payload and returned. Neither ever contacted an anchor.
 *
 * SEP-24 is a three-part protocol and this module covers all three:
 *
 *   1. **Discovery** — read the anchor's `TRANSFER_SERVER` from its
 *      `stellar.toml`, so a caller supplies a domain rather than hard-coding
 *      an endpoint that can move.
 *   2. **Initiation** — `POST /transactions/{deposit,withdraw}/interactive`,
 *      which returns a URL the user completes in a popup.
 *   3. **Polling** — `GET /transaction?id=…` until the status is terminal.
 *
 * The third part is the one that is easy to skip and impossible to omit: the
 * anchor does its work out of band, so the popup closing tells you nothing
 * about whether the transfer happened.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md
